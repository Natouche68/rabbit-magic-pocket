Start by making a prediction and take out the random 8 to deal it face-down on
the table.

Next, with the deck facing-up, deal cards on the table. Once you saw the two 8,
say to the spectator that he can say "stop" whenever they want to cut the deck.

Next, put both piles face-down. Ask the spectator which pile they want to look,
to give them a sense of control, but in every case, turn the top card of the
deck.

Because it is an 8, take the cutted packet face-down and deal 8 cards. Flip the
top cards of the 2 new created packets.

You can finally reveal your prediction, which is the final 8.
