This trick needs **27** cards, which the spectator can shuffle. This trick is
very psychological, so insist on your performance.

Start by dealing 3 piles of 9 cards on the table.

Ask the spectator to choose a pile. Show them that pile : they now have to
choose and remember a card in it, without taking it. They can finally shuffle
the 27 cards how they want.

Deal again 3 piles on the table, face-down. Tell the spectator to hover their
hand over the piles, and to try feeling a pull from their card. When they choose
a pile, show them, and ask them if their card is in there. If not, ask them to
try again until they find the correct one. If yes, put this pile on top of the 2
others, and do this whole operation 3 times.

The spectator's card is now in the 7th position from the top. Ask them to deal
card, really slowly, and to try feeling again their card. Usually, they'll stop
around the 6th or 7th card, in which case you can tell them to look at the card
on top of the deck or the last dealt one. In the other case, eliminate chunks of
cards using "the magician's choice", while always giving them a sense of
control. At the end, they should end up with their selected card.
