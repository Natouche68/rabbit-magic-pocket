This trick needs **52** cards, without joker, which the spectator can shuffle.

Give 9 cards to the spectator and ask them to choose one of them, remember it,
and putting it back on top. Put the rest of the deck on top, in little chunks if
you want. You can do some false cuts too.

Deal now cards using these instructions :

- Deal cards face-up by counting from 10 to 1.
- If the card value and the number you said are equal, start a new pile. _(The
  kings, queens and jacks are valued 10.)_
- If you arrived at 0, deal one more card face-down which will have the value 0.
- Create 4 piles.

Once you made these 4 piles, add the value of each card on top of each pile, and
deal the corresponding number of cards. The card corresponding exactly to this
value is the spectator's selected card.
