You can use any deck for this trick, which the spectator can shuffle.

Start by having the spectator select 6 cards, without looking at them ! They can shuffle them, choose one card, and shuffle the whole thing again.

When you take the packet back, put it on top of the deck and flip it. Look at the cards and try to read the spectator's mind. Take out an arbitrary card and put it face-down on the table.

As you flip the 5 cards remaining, do a turn-over pass : take about half of the deck (with the 5 cards) in your hand. With your middle, ring, and pinky finger, rotate the bottom packet. Finally put the top packet on top of the deck. This puts the 5 cards in the center of the deck as you flip it.

Show the spectator could select any card of the deck as you show it. Turn the deck face-down, and take out the 5-top cards. Place the "spectator's" card in the center of the deck for safekeeping.

Ask for the spectator their card. Show that it isn't in the 5 arbitrary cards. Go to the center of the deck, where they will find their selected card.
