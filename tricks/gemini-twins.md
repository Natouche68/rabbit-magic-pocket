This trick needs a **full** deck of 52 cards, which the spectator can shuffle.

Start by making 2 predictions with the deck facing you : first take the soulmate
(same value and same color) of the first card, then the soulmate of the last
card.

Show these predictions and say that you will, of course, not find these cards,
but their soulmates. You can then give some false cuts to the deck, or a riffle
shuffle maintaining the top and bottom cards.

Now have the spectator deal how many cards they want on the table face-down,
then place the first prediction face-up, and the rest of the deck on top. Do the
same thing for the second prediction.

The spectator can give some cuts too.

Finally, spread the deck, and find the 2 face-up cards. Take them and the 2
cards they are facing to : they are their soulmates.
