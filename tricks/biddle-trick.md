For this trick, you can use any deck, which the spectator can shuffle.

Start by asking the spectator to choose a card and to remember it. You now have to control this card third from the top. You have 2 options :

- You can either do an overhand shuffle control : throw a small packet with the spectator's card on top, throw 2 more cards and in-jog. Shuffle the rest on top, and cut where you in-jogged.
- Or you can grab a pinky break under the 2-top cards and slide the card there.

Next, ask the spectator to cut the deck. They can keep the bottom half and you take the top one. Turn over 5 cards on the top.

For the rest of the trick, ask your spectator to not say anything.

Take the deck in your dominant hand in a biddle grip (thumb on the bottom and middle finger on top). Peel off the top card with your thumb in your non-dominant hand and show it. Repeat this for the 5 cards, while making sure the cards you already have in your second hand go beneath the deck.

> While you're peeling the spectator's card (the third one) grab a pinky break. When you peel the fourth one, ditch this card on the bottom of the deck using the pinky break.
>
> That's why you have to go under the deck with your hand everytime, to make the ditching less suspicious.

Give the rest of the deck to the spectator.

Grab the 4 cards in a biddle grip like earlier. Use the same trick (grab a break on the second card and ditching it) to count the cards and make it seems you have 5 of them.

Wave these cards and riffle them if you want. Show the spectator you only have 4 cards. When they think their card has disappeared, make them look at the deck.

The one card facing a different direction is their selected card.
