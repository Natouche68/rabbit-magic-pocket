This trick needs **52** cards, without joker, which the spectator can shuffle.

Start by asking the spectator to choose a card, take it and memorize it.

Now, control the card to the bottom of the deck. You can do an double undercut
or an overhand shuffle with the spectator's card on top.

Ask the spectator to divide the deck into 3 packets, but be sure to note where
is the spectator's card.

For the next part of the trick, ask the spectator to not say anything, you will
try to "read their facial expressions". Next, show the bottom card of each pile
and "ask" them if that's their card. Say you don't think so, and put that card
on the side.

When you arrive at the pile with the spectator's card, do a bottom glide to peel
the second bottom card.

Next, put the deck back together and "shuffle" it, but keep the spectator's card
on the bottom.

Ask a number between 1 and 10, and peel off that many card from the "bottom"
using a bottom glide. For the last card, take the spectator's card.

Now ask what was their card, and seem surprised by what you hold. Go back to 3
cards on the side and reveal them slowly, with the "selected" card last. When
the spectator thinks their card has disappeared, show them their selected card.
