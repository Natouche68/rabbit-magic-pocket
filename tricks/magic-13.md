This trick needs **52** cards, without joker, which the spectator can shuffle.

Create as much piles as you can while following these rules :

- Deal one card face-up.
- Count to 13 starting from the value of the dealed card. _(The kings are valued
  13, the queens 12 and the jacks 11.)_
- Flip the whole pile upside-down.

Once you created all the piles, ask the spectator to keep only 3 of them. Take
all the others back in the deck.

Ask them now to pick 2, and show the card on top of these 2 piles. Add the value
of these cards, add 10, and deal that many cards on the table.

The numbers of cards left in the deck is the value of the top card of the last
pile.
