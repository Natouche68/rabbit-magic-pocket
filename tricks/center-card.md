This trick needs **52** cards, which the spectator can shuffle.

Start by telling the spectator to choose a card, take it, and remeber it. Next,
ask them to cut the deck in half, as precisly as humanly possible ! This is very
important ! They can then place their card in between the 2 piles.

You can do some false cuts if you want. Ask now the spectator to deal 4 piles on
the table. Take each pile, show it and ask if their selected card is in there.
If that's the case, keep it and put the rest away.

Next, ask again the spectator to deal 4 piles face-down. Say you will now
proceed by elimination.

Put away the pile with 4 cards. Keep then the card in the center of each
remaining pile. The spectator's card is always the middle one.
