Ask the spectator to choose a card and to remember it without taking it out.

Next, take the deck face-down, and in-jog a card in your other hand, out-jog the
next, in-jog, out-jog...

Take the out-jogged cards and show them to the spectator. If the spectator's
card is in there, place it on top, otherwise, place it on the bottom. Repeat
this operation 3 times.

Next, deal 2 piles on the table face-down. Turn the whole right pile : it will
say if the spectator's card is a king or a queen.

Take the left packet and deal it into 2 other piles. Flip the new right packet :
it will say the color of their card.

Shift the top card of the left packet, and turn the other card : it will tell
the suit of the spectator's card.

Finally, flip the last card : it will be the spectator's selected card.
