You can use any deck for this trick, which the spectator can shuffle.

When you take the deck back, find a 6 and cut at the card just below it, in order to have a 6 at the second position from the top when face-down. (You could do it before the trick too).

Now take 9 cards from the top, and ask the spectator to do a deal and a duck (deal one card, duck one card on the bottom) until there is only one card left, which is the 6. Put it on the side, this is the prediction.

Next, ask the spectator to choose a card. They can shuffle the whole thing too if they want.

For the rest of the trick, ask your spectator to lie but sell it as the truth, to make it more funny.

Now, with the deck facing the spectator, out-jog the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th cards. Ask your spectator if they card is in there (knowing that they lie). If they say yes, put these cards on top of the rest, otherwise, on the bottom.

The spectator's card will then be in the 6th position. To shuffle the cards while maintaining the 6th card, you can peel off 3 cards, put it on the bottom, then 4 cards. You can finally reveal your prediction, deal 6 cards, and reveal the spectator's selected card.
