You can use any deck for this trick, which the spectator can shuffle.

Start by showing the deck is completly shuffled. While squaring the deck, grab a pinky break under the last card. Flip the deck, except the bottom card, while making sure not to flash it !

> [!warning]

> Make sure to always flip the deck the same way to make it less suspicious !

Cut the deck in 2, take the top half. While turning your hand with the bottom half, flip the top half and place it on top of your hand. Use the top half as misdirection.

Now grab the bottom half in your hand, and place it on top of the other one. Say then that you have cards in opposing directions.

Flip the deck a few times, and, with the card opposing a different way on the bottom, take a random card, and place it on top.

Now reveal the deck, and say that this card made all the cards face the same direction.
