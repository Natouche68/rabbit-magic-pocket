This trick needs a full deck of 52 cards, which the spectator can shuffle.

Start by making a prediction. Take the soulmate (same color and same value) of the card on top of the deck, and put it face-down on the table.

Now ask the spectator to choose 5 cards (excluding the one of top) and out-jog them.

> [!warning]
>
> Out-jog a little bit more the third card and a little bit less the fifth card !

Now swiwwle the 4 cards on top of the deck, while pushing back the fifth card back into it, in order to have the prediction soulmate in the 5th position.

Take the 5 cards on top of the deck, and shuffle them twice by interleaving the 2 bottom cards into the 2 top cards.

Next, give the deck back to the spectator and ask them to do a "deal and a duck".

You can reveal the prediction, and the other card, which are soulmates.
