You can use any deck for this trick, which the spectator can shuffle.

While taking out the aces from the deck, say you will tell a story about a
cheater, who can deal the aces whenever they want. Put the aces on top and give
the deck a false cut.

Deal 4 piles on the table face-down, each one starting with an ace. Then, grab
them back onto the top of the deck.

Say that someone called out the cheater. So, the cheater (and you) deals 4 hands
of 3 cards. They flip them over and show they are completely random. Put them
back into the deck in the inverse order of dealing, and give the deck a false
cut.

The one who called out the cheater is not satisfied, so they (and you) deal
again 4 hands of 3 cards. The cheater flips the last 2 dealt hands, and shows
they're completely random. Put the hands back into the deck, so that the first
hand ends up on top, and the second second from top.

The one who called out the cheater is sad and goes away, but inside them, the
cheater is happy because they know they can control the aces wherever they want,
and while doing that, deal the 4 cards on top of the deck face-up.
