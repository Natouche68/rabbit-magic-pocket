This trick needs **52** cards, without joker, which the spectator can shuffle.

Once the spectator shuffled the deck, shuffle it one last time with a riffle
shuffle. While you're squaring the deck, look at the top card and remember it :
this is your key-card.

Next, close your eyes. Ask the spectator to choose a card in the middle of the
deck, which they can memorize. They can then cut the deck, and flip the top
half. They now have to put their card face-up on this half, and riffle shuffle
the whole thing back together. Finally, they can cut the deck and turn it over
if they want to.

You can now open your eyes. During the rest of the trick, give the impression
you're reading the spectator's mind.

Spred the deck and look for your key card. If you see it, you're on the right
side, otherwise, flip the deck. The spectator's card is the first face-up card
below your key-card.

Gradually eliminate chunk of cards until you arrive at the spectator's selected
card, which you can finally slowly reveal.
