This tricks needs **9** cards, which the spectator can shuffle.

Deal 3 piles of 3 cards. Ask the spectator to choose one and remember the card
beneath it. Put this pile on top of the 2 others.

Ask them what their card was, and spell it using these rules :

- For each letter, deal one card on the table.
- Once a word has been spelled, put the deck on top of the dealed card and start
  the next word.

Finally, spell `MAGIC` using the same rules. The card dealt on C will be the
spectator's selected card.
