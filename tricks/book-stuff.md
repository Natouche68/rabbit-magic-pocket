Once you did some false shuffles and false cuts, allow the spectator to cut as many times they want.

Have them not complete the final cut. Turn cards until you have a card between 1 and 5.

The first card will tell the book to look. Turn another card, it will indicate the page. The next one tells the line, and the last the word.

Because of the Si Stebbins stack, there are only 5 possibilities of words, one for each book, so you immediatly know which one they'll have.

Once they saw their word, you can do a mentalism trick and reveal their word.
