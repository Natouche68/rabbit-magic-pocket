You can use any deck for this trick, which the spectator can shuffle.

When you take the deck back, crim the bottom card with your pinky. Now close
your eyes, and ask the spectator to deal how many cards they want (and remember
the number), to look at the last dealt card, and put the rest of the deck on
top.

Next, find where your crimmed card is, and take the card underneath it (the
spectator's card). Do a double lift, and show that this isn't their card, and
put it (the correct card) face-down on the table.

You must now cut the deck at the crimmed card. You can have the spectator do
this, because they will usually cut it at the correct place with a crim.

Have them deal the same number of cards as the beginning, and look at the last
dealt card. It will be your card you showed earlier, so you can reveal the
spectator's selected card on the table.
