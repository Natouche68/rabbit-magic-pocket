You can start by giving the deck a few cuts.

Next, riffle the cards and ask the spectator to say "stop". Wherever they say
"stop", split the deck, take the 2 cards on top of 1 pile and ask the spectator
to remember these cards _(1 red and 1 black)_.

When you put them back in the deck, make sure to change the order in which you
took them !

You can now "suffle" the deck by cutting it.

Finallly, deal 2 piles on the table, and slowly reveal them face-up. The only
cards which will have a different color will be the spectator's selected card.
