You can use any deck for this trick, which the spectator can shuffle.

Start by making a prediction. Look at the first and last card of the deck, and
be sure that they have a different value and suit. Otherwise, cut the deck.

Now look for the card with the value of the first card and the suit of the last
card. Put it face-down on the table.

Now ask the spectator to choose a card without taking it. Be sure that he
doesn't choose the top or bottom card. Be sure to note its position, by
out-jogging it a little for example.

Now take the deck face-up and do this manipulation :

- Take the part of the deck before the spectator's card and turn it face down.
- Take the spectator's card with it and flip the whole thing.
- Flip the part that was below under the spectator's card and place it back, so
  that the only card facing differently is the spectator's card.

It essentially places the previously top and bottom cards next to the chosen
card.

Spread the deck face-down, and take out the spectator's card and the 2 cards
next to it.

The card above give the value, and the card below the suit. Flip them and show
finally your prediction.
