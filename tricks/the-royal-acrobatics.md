This trick needs **52** cards, with the ace, king, queen, and jack of spades,
without joker, which the spectator can shuffle.

When you receive the deck back, look for the ace of clubs and cut the deck
there. Now look for the jack, queen, king, and ace, and place them in this order
in the deck face-up. Show the 4 cards to the spectator and say that this royal
family will do more and more extreme _"salto mortale"_.

Now, do a bottom glide to deal the queen, king, ace of spades and the ace of
clubs face-down. Control then the jack of spades to the top of the deck, with an
overhand shuffle for example.

Now put the deck on top of the "jack" (the queen), which will do a simple
_"salto mortale"_. Riffle the cards and show the jack on top of the deck.

Next, put the "queen" (the king) on top of the deck, which will do a inverse
_"salto mortale"_. Riffle the cards to the bottom and show the queen.

Take the deck face-up and put the "king" (the ace of spades) face-down wherever
you want. Flip the deck, and show the king on top of the deck.

Finally, take the "ace of spades" (the ace of clubs) and put it somewhere in the
deck face-down. You can show the "`1`" to convince the spectator. Spread the
deck, and you will see the ace of spades face-up.
