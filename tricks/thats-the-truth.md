For this trick, you can use any deck, without joker, which the spectator can
shuffle.

Start by having the spectator pick a card and remember it. You must then control
this card to the top. You can either do 2 overhand shuffle controls or a double
undercut.

Next, take the deck facing you and say you will programm it. You can see the
last card is the spectator's card. First, cut the deck in order to have at the
second-to-last position a card of the same suit. In the third-to-last position,
you must have an even card or an odd one corresponding to the spectator's card.
Finally, in the fourth-to-last position, put a card of the same color.

Now, with the deck face-down, put 6 cards on the table, without dealing them one
by one. You can then deal 5 more cards on top.

Take this small packet of cards, and do an anti-faro : out-jog the 2nd, 4th,
6th, ... cards. Turn over the last card (just to make it more asthetically
pleasing), and flip the whole thing in order to have the face-down card closer
to the spectator.

You can now tell the spectator that this trick is a lie detector and that they
can choose to lie or tell the truth.

Have the spectator press on the face-down card ("to make a connection" and make
it easier when pushing the cards). Ask them the color of their card, and push
the out-jogged cards. The cards will each time tell the truth. Turn the whole
thing to have the face-down card closer to the spectator again, and ask them if
it was an even or odd card. Push the out-joged cards, turn the "lie detector"
and ask the suit of the card. Again, push the cards and turn.

Finally, for the last time, ask them what was their card. The card appearing
when you push into the thing is the spectator's selected card.
