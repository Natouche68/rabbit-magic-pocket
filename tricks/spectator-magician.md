This trick needs **10** cards, without joker, which the spectator can shuffle.

Ask the spectator to look at the deck face-up, to choose a card and to remember
its position from the top (the side closer to you).

Next, cut the deck after 5 cards and give back the deck to your spectator. They
have to swap cards from the top to the bottom corresponding to the position of
their card.

Finally, they can do a duck and a deal : they swap a card from the top to the
bottom, and they deal one on the table, they swap a card, they deal one... until
there is only one card left. It will be the spectator's selected card.
