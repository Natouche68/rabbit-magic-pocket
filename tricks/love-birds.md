You can use any deck for this trick, which the spectator can shuffle.

Start by telling the spectator this trick is a test of your connection. Now ask
them to divide the deck in 2, and to take one of the pile. You take the other
one.

Now ask them to choose a card in their pile and put it on top of it. Say you do
the same, except you will remember in reality the card on the bottom.

Next, put your pile on top of the spectator's one, and allow them to cut it as
much as they want.

Finally, ask them to deal cards from the top until they see your card. They can
then turn the next card, the one your card found : the spectator's selected
card.
