This trick needs **52** cards, without joker, which the spectator can shuffle.
It works best with 3 spectators.

Start by asking the 3 spectators to choose a card each. While they are
memorizing these, create 4 piles on the table, from right to left : one of 10
cards, two of 15 cards, and one of 9 cards.

Next, ask spectator 1 to put their card on top of the first pile (the one with
10 cards) and to cut on top of it a part of the second pile. Spectator 2 can put
their card on top of the second pile, and cut the third pile. Finally, spectator
3 can put their card on the third pile. You can then put all the deck together
by going left to right (the pile with 9 cards must be on top and the one with 10
cards on the bottom).

Next, deal 2 packets of cards, one face-up and the other face-down. Ask the
spectators to say "stop" whenever they see their cards, which they will never
see. Repeat this operation until there are only 3 cards left.

> [!warning]
>
> On the third time dealing the cards, start with the **face-down** cards, and
> then the face-up cards. During the fourth time, you can continue as normal.

The last 3 cards will be the spectators' selected cards.
