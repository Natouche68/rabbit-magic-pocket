> Take one random carrmd in the deck and find its pair (same value and same color). Start 2 piles with these. Repeat this operation with all cards of the deck.

You can start by cutting the deck. Next, say you need some "assistants" and take the red queens out of the deck.

Ask now the spectator to choose a card and take it, without seeing it ! Cut the deck where this card was.

Take the deck face-down and count 9 cards from the top, place one the queen there, and put all the deck back together. Do the same thing from the bottom.

Next, deal 2 piles on the table. Keep the pile where both the queens are. Repeat this operation until there is only the 2 queens and one other card left.

This card and the spectator's selected card form a pair. They can now see their card.
