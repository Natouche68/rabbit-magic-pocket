Start by giving the deck some **single** cuts or false cuts. The spectator can
do it too. Then, place down the deck on the table and close your eyes.

Ask the spectator to take out a small packet of cards from the deck (about 10
cards), and place them inside the box.

You can now open your eyes, and tell the spectator a deck of playing cards can
be used as a computer. To "program" it, give it false cut. While saying "the
deck has been programmed", take a quick look at the value of the bottom card.

Next, subtract the value of that card to 13, and deal off that many cards from
the deck, while making it seem you're trying to feel a vibration from the cards.
The card corresponding exactly have the same value as the number of cards in the
packet the spectator took away.
