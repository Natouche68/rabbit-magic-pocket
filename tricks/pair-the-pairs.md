Place a pile on the second one. You can "shuffle" the deck by cutting it. It is
very important to not disturb the sequence of the cards.

Next, deal half the cards on the table. Put the other half next to it. The 2
piles must present the same sequence but in opposing directions.

Repeat now these operations util there is only one card left :

- Ask the spectator to distribute _`n-1`_ swaps between the 2 piles, where _`n`_
  is the number of cards in a pile. _(A swap consists of taking the top card and
  placing it at the bottom)_
- Take the 2 cards on top of each pile and put them together on the side.

Turn the 2 last cards, which have the same value. You can then slowly reveal all
the other pairs, of same value each time too.
