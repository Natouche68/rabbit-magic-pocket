These tricks are so simple that all of them fit in a single guide !

## Count the cut

This trick needs **52** cards, without joker, which the spectator can shuffle.

Start by asking the spectator to pick a card. While they are looking at it, put
in your second hand 25 cards, without giving the impresson you're counting them.

Put the spectator's card on the top of the deck, and the 25 cards above it.

Ask the spectator to take about a quarter of the deck and put it on the side.
(If they want to take more, say you want more cards to work with.)

Now say you will try to find it. Deal 25 cards on the table, while giving the
impression you're trying to "feel" them. Once you dealt 25 cards, say you think
you want too far.

Now, count the number of cards in the packet the spectator cut, and deal that
many cards from the top of the 25 cards packet. The card corresponding exactly
will be the spectator selected card.

## Turn a card over

For this trick, you can use any deck, which the spectator can shuffle.

Start by discretely flipping the 2 bottom cards. Ask now the spectator to choose
a card, without flashing the 2 bottom ones. While they are memorizing it, flip
the deck.

Put the deck on the table and slide the spectator's card into the deck face-down
(while the deck is in reality face-up). Turn the top card over and show that
this isn't their card.

You can now wave the cards, and spread the deck (without flashing the card you
flipped at the beginning). The only card facing a different direction will be
the spectator's selected card.

## Magical spectator

You can use any deck for this trick. The spectator can shuffle it.

Start by cutting the deck wherever the spectator wants. Next, do a double lift
to show the second card from the top.

Place these two cards on top, take the top card (not the spectator's), and put
it somewhere in the deck.

Now shuffle the deck, with a riffle shuffle for example, in order to control the
card on top.

Next, ask to spectator to say "stop" while you're riffling the cards. At that
moment, quicly, do a slip force : take the part on top except the first card and
let it fall on the rest of the deck. If done correctly, it gives the impression
the card was there the whole time.

You can finally reveal the spectator's selected card.

## 3 magical spectators

This trick needs **52** cards, without joker, which the spectator can shuffle.
It works best with 3 spectators.

Once a spectator shuffled the deck, look quickly at the bottom card and remember
it.

Next, ask another spectator to spread the card like a casino wash, but stop it
relatively early so you can see where the bottom card is now.

Now ask a spectator to pick the card they believe to be the card you saw on the
bottom. Of course, they won't really picked it. Look at what card it is, put it
on the side. Repeat this with 2 others spectators by asking the card you just
saw.

Finally, say you will take the card corresponding to what the last spectator
actually picked, but you will choose the bottom card, the one the first
spectator supposedly took. You essentially created a loop with a 1-card offset.

Shuffle the 4 cards but keep the order coherent with what you asked. You can now
reveal the cards, which seem to correspond exactly.
