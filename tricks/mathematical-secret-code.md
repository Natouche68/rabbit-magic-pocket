This trick needs **27** cards, which the spectator can shuffle.

Start by asking the spectator to take a card and memorize it. They can then
shuffle the deck.

To help you, ask a number between 1 and 27, and calculate your secret code in
order of the rows following these rules : _(where B means BOTTOM, M means
MIDDLE, and T means TOP)_

**By adding the digits of the number :**

|  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  B  |  M  |  T  |  B  |  M  |  T  |  B  |  M  |  T  |
|  B  |  B  |  B  |  M  |  M  |  M  |  T  |  T  |  T  |

**With the number as is :**

| 1-9 | 10-18 | 19-27 |
| :-: | :---: | :---: |
|  B  |   M   |   T   |

Next, take the deck face-**down** and deal 3 piles on the table face-up. Ask the
spectator in which pile their card is in. While putting the deck back together
face-**up**, respect the position of the spectator's pile corresponding to your
secret code. Repeat this operation 3 times by taking the correct row in the
table.

Finally, take the deck face-**down** and deal cards corresponding to the
spectator's number. The card corresponding exactly will be the spectator's
selected card.
