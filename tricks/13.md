This trick needs **52** cards, which the spectator can shuffle.

First ask the spectator to choose 13 cards (because "it's a magic number with special capabilities in a deck of cards"). They can now select 3 cards among these and keep them. While they're doing that, take a quick look at the bottom card of the deck, and remember it.

Put the deck on top of the rest of the cards.

Say that you will make a prediction based on the 3 cards the spectator selected. Write on a piece of paper the card you saw earlier.

Because 13 is magic number, deal now cards counting from the value of one of the selected cards to 13. Do that for the 2 others cards, and place all these face-down cards back into the bottom of the deck.

You can give it a false cut to "arrange the deck in a special order".

Finally, add the values of the 3 cards, and deal that many cards from the deck. The card corresponding exactly is the prediction you made earlier.
