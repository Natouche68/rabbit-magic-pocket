You can use any deck for this trick, which the spectator can shuffle.

Start by asking the spectator to cut the deck in 3 piles. They can choose a pile, and remember any card within it, without taking it out !

Now say that their card is in the 7th position (or another number if you want). Have them deal all cards one by one and remember where their card is. As they're dealing the cards, remember the first dealt card, this will be your key-card. You can look away after that if you want.

Next, they can put the pile in the deck face-down, and give it as many cut as they want.

Now look at the deck, and say you try to find their card. Look for your key-card, and count (including it) 7 cards (or the other number) on top of it. Cut at that location.

Ask for the location of their card. You now have 2 outcomes.

## If their position is less than your number

You need to count cards from the bottom of the deck using this formula : `(your number) - (spectator's location) **+ 1**`.

The card corresponding exactly will be the spectator's selected card.

## If their position is more than your number

You need to count cards from the bottom of the deck using this formula : `(spectator's location) - (your number)`.

The card corresponding exactly will be the spectator's selected card.
