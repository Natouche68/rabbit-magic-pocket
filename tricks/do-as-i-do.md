> You need a doubleback card on the top of the deck. You can either use a real doublebacker or create one by stacking 2 cards together. The doublebacker needs to be marked in order for you to recognize it quickly.

Start by doing a shuffle while controlling the top card, then have your spectator split the deck into 2 piles. Take the top half and give the other one to the spectator.

For the rest of the trick, you and your spectator will do (almost) the same thing.

Both of you will put your pile behind your back, and select one random card. You can look at it and remember it.

Then ask your spectator to put their card on top of their deck (still behind their back). Say you will do the same thing, but in reality, put it on the bottom and flip it, keeping the doublebacker on top.

Next, put your packet on top of the spectator's. Have them take the deck behind their back, take the top card (which they think is yours) and put it near the center where their's is.

Spread the deck, you will see your card face-up. Take the card below it, this is the spectator's selected card.

> If you see the supposed selected card is the doublebacker, just say that since they are a beginner, they are off by one.
