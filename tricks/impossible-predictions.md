Spread the deck face-up to show the spectator the deck is completely "normal".
Say you don't need the jokers and take them back, but be careful to note where
they were !

Split it into 2 packets : the special packet and the other one, which you can
recognize with the presence of a joker. Give the special packet to the spectator
and ask them to do exactly like you.

Shuffle your deck how you want, and put it on the table. Take approximately half
of it and put it next to the other's pile and turn it upside-down. Shuffle it
again. Repeat this operation a second time.

Put the 2 parts together, but be sure to flip one of them upside-down !

Next, spread the deck. If you see the ace of spades, turn the deck over. If you
see other spades, you're on the right side.

Reveal your first prediction and count the number of face-down cards. Reveal the
next one and count the black cards, and say there is only clubs.

When a spectator sees the ace of spades, reveal your final prediction.
