This trick needs **52** cards, without joker, which the spectator can shuffle.

Divide the deck into 2 equal piles (26 cards). Next, ask the spectator to cut
one the pile, and to choose a card in the other one. Once they have memorized
it, they can put it back on top.

Shuffle the deck in order to control the spectator's card on the bottom. You can
for example do an overhand shuffle and peel the top card, which goes then on the
bottom.

Put this pile on what's left of the pile the spectator cut. Next, "shuffle" this
deck by peeling the bottom and top card and dealing them on the table. Do this
for the whole deck. The spectator can do it too.

You will now need the help of the cutted packet. Count the number of cards in
it, and deal the corresponding number of cards of the other deck. The card
corresponding exactly will be the spectator's selected card.
