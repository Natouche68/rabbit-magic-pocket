Start by allowing the spectator to cut the deck.

Next deal one (`1²`) card on the table.

Then take 4 cards (`2²`) and put them on the table. Do not deal them one by one
! Do the same thing with 9 cards (`3²`).

Turn over the 4-cards and 3-cards piles. The 4-cards pile shows the suit of the
one card and the 9-cards pile its value.

You can finally reveal the one card.

To put the deck again in Si Stebbins stack, and re-do the trick, simply put
first the 9-cards pile on top of the deck, then the 4 cards, and finally the one
last card.
