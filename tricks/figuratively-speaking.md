You can use any deck for this trick. A spectator can shuffle it. It works best
with 2 spectators.

First, ask spectator 1 to think of a number between 5 and 15, and to whisper it
quietly to spectator 2.

Now take the deck facing you to "make a prediction", and memorize the top and
bottom card. For your prediction, write on a piece of paper the card on top of
the deck when face-down, and put it in the box for example.

Next, with you closing you eyes, ask spectator 1 to deal the number of cards
corresponding to their number, and to look and remember the last card they've
dealt. They can put the rest of the deck on top and cut it.

Now take back the deck and make the second prediction. Go find your key-card you
previously predicted, and count (including this card) the number of cards
between it and your second key-card (excluding it) : that's the number the
spectator are thinking of. The card just above your second key-card is spectator
1's card : write it on a piece of paper and put it in the box. Finally, cut the
deck between this card and your second key card.

You can now ask spectator 2 to do the same thing as spectator 1 : deal cards and
remember the last one. They can cut the deck too or shuffle it.

Now say the spectators' number out loud, and take their cards out of the deck
(or you could also ask them). Take back your predictions too, but keep in mind
they're inversed !

You can finally reveal the predictions you made.
