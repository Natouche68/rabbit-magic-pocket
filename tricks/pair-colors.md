> For this trick, you need to prepare 2 piles of different colors but same size.
> You can show them face-up.

Start by putting one packet on the other, but flip it ! The spectator can then
shuffle the deck, but be sure that he doesn't flip any card.

Next, deal one card as is, one card and flip it, one card as is, one card and
flip it...

Now do the same thing but take 2 cards, and ask the spectator if they want to
flip it or not. You can repeat this how many times the spectator wants but
always with an even number of cards.

Deal 2 piles on the table. When you put the 2 packets back together, be sure to
flip one of them ! You can ask the spectator which one to flip to give them a
sense of control.

All cards of the same color will be facing the same direction.
